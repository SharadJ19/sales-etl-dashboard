- Implemented analytics queries for:
  - Top customers
  - Monthly revenue
  - Best-selling products
  - Category-level revenue
  - Orders per weekday
  - Customer distribution
  - Price vs quantity sold  
- Generated professional visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

  - Raw data viewing  
  - ETL pipeline trigger  
  - Analytics visualizations  
  - Clean, responsive UI  

**Result:**  
*"The project demonstrates end-to-end data engineering skills, from data ingestion to actionable insights. It showcases Python, MySQL, ETL, analytics, visualization, and dashboard deployment skills."*

## 2️⃣ Technical Breakdown

### 🛠 ETL Pipeline
- **Extraction:** Reads CSVs for customers, products, and sales.  
- **Transformation:**  
  - Drops invalid rows  
  - Fills missing city/category  
  - Converts order dates to datetime  
  - Calculates revenue (`quantity * price`)  
  - Creates a date dimension (year, month, day, quarter)  
- **Load:**  
  - Uses SQLAlchemy to create fact and dimension tables  
  - Enforces primary & foreign keys  
  - Truncates existing tables for clean reload  
- **Talking Points:**  
  - Data validation and cleaning strategies  
  - Handling missing or inconsistent data  
  - Scaling ETL with chunking, Spark, or cloud solutions  

### 🗄 Database Design
- **Schema:** Star schema (`dim_customer`, `dim_product`, `dim_date`, `fact_sales`)  
- **Keys:** Primary & foreign keys for referential integrity  
- **Indexes:** Suggested on `date_id`, `customer_id`, `product_id`  
- **Talking Points:**  
  - Why star schema? Fast aggregations & analytics  
  - Normalization vs denormalization trade-offs  

### 📊 Analytics Queries
- **Metrics Implemented:**  
  1. Top 5 customers by revenue  
  2. Monthly revenue trend  
  3. Top 10 best-selling products  
  4. Revenue per category  
  5. Average order value per month  
  6. Orders per weekday  
  7. Quantity sold per category  
  8. Top 5 cities by revenue  
  9. Customer distribution by city  
  10. Price vs quantity sold  
- **Talking Points:**  
  - Business value of metrics  
  - Aggregations, grouping, ordering, and limits  

### 📈 Visualizations
- **Tools:** Matplotlib + Seaborn  
- **Design Choices:**  
  - Consistent color theme  
  - Two-column layout for charts  
  - Simplified titles, axes, and legends  
- **Interview Tip:** Explain charts in 1 sentence:  
  *"This bar chart shows top 5 customers, highlighting high-value clients for targeting."*

### 🌐 Web Dashboard
- **Stack:** Flask + Bootstrap 5  
- **Features:**  
  - Raw data view (500 rows)  
  - ETL trigger  
  - Analytics visualizations  
  - Responsive, professional UI  
- **UI/UX:**  
  - Navbar/footer consistent with charts  
  - Plot cards with shadows and rounded corners  
  - Navigation buttons  
- **Talking Points:**  
  - Usability and clean code  
  - Deployment options: Render, Vercel, or cloud  

## 3️⃣ Common Follow-Up Questions & Talking Points

| Topic | Answer / Talking Point |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Scalability** | Pipeline can scale with Spark or chunked Pandas; MySQL can migrate to RDS. |
| **Automation / Scheduling** | Use Airflow or Cron jobs for daily ETL. |
| **Error Handling** | Drop invalid rows, fill missing values, log failures. |
| **Real-Time Data** | Currently batch ETL; could implement streaming with Kafka or Spark Streaming. |
| **Interactive Charts** | Could replace static PNGs with Plotly/Dash. |
| **Business Impact** | Provides insights for revenue, top customers, and products. |
| **Deployment** | Flask app can deploy on Render; MySQL on cloud. CI/CD possible. |
| **Future Enhancements** | Authentication, role-based access, real-time analytics, anomaly detection. |
